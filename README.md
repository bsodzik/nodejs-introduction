===================

Exemplary code used during my "Introduction to Node.js" presentation. Slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1j1TXNONDkCzxBtWd1dGy92fdSTUUNf0y4AOn9Wg9pxU/edit?usp=sharing).

Please have in mind that dependencies are not committed to GitHub, therefore you may need to download them before running code with command

	npm install
